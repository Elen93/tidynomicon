## Audience

**Padma**, 28, has been using Python and Pandas for the last four years to analyze agricultural production in southeast Asia.
She has just completed her PhD and accepted a job with a development bank whose staff use R instead.
Padma wants learn how do the things she has been doing in Python:
read data, clean it, explore it, model it, and present it.

**Dafydd**, 37, has been building performance dashboards for a logistics company using Django and D3.
The company has just hired some data scientists who use R,
and Dafydd would like to try building some dashboards in Shiny.
He doesn't need to know much about statistics---the analysts will take care of that---but
he wants to learn enough of the language to tidy up their packages.

Derived constraints:

- Learners understand loops, conditionals, writing and calling functions, lists, and dictionaries,
  can load and use libraries,
  and can use classes and objects,
  but do not know how to create new classes
  or how to use higher-order functions.
- Learners understand mean, variation, correlation, and other basic statistical concepts,
  but are not familiar with statistical tests.
- Learners are comfortable creating and interpreting plots of various kinds.
- Learners have experience with spreadsheets and with writing database queries that use filtering, aggregation, and joins,
  but have not designed database schemas.
- Learners have no experience building web applications
  and are not familiar with version control systems or unit testing.
- Learners know how to use a text editor
  but have never used an IDE.
