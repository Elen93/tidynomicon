- Create `for` loops and `if`/`else` statements in R.
- Explain why vectors cannot be used directly in conditional expressions and correctly use `all` and `any` to combine their values.
- Define functions taking a fixed number of named arguments and/or a variable number of arguments.
- Explain what vectorization is and create vectorized equivalents of unnested loops containing simple conditional tests.
