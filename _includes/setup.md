1.  Create an account on [rstudio.cloud][rstudio-cloud],
    then create a new project and start typing.
2.  Alternatively:
    1.  [Install R][r-install].
        We recommend that you do *not* use conda, Brew, or other platform-specific package managers to do this,
        as they sometimes only install part of what you need.
    2.  [Install RStudio][rstudio-install].
    3.  In the RStudio console,
        run `install.packages("tidyverse")` to install the tidyverse libraries.
        We will install others as we go along,
        but we're going to need this soon.
