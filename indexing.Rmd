```{r include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
```

One of the things that newcomers to R often trip over is the various ways in which structures can be indexed.
All of the following are legal:

```{r eval=FALSE}
thing[i]
thing[i, j]
thing[[i]]
thing[[i, j]]
thing$name
thing$"name"
```

but they can behave differently depending on what kind of thing `thing` is.
To explain, we must first take a look at lists.

## How can I store a mix of different types of objects?

A list in R is a vector that can contain values of many different types.
(The technical term for this is [heterogeneous](../glossary/#heterogeneous),
in contrast with the [homogeneous](../glossary/#homogeneous) nature of vectors' values.)
We'll use this list in our examples:

```{r}
thing <- list("first", c(2, 20, 200), 30)
thing
```

The output tells us that the first element of `thing` is a vector of one element,
that the second is a vector of three elements,
and the third is again a vector of one element.

## What is the difference between `[` and `[[`?

The output above strongly suggests that we can get the elements of a list using `[[` (double square brackets):

```{r}
thing[[1]]
thing[[2]]
thing[[3]]
```

Let's have a look at the types of those three values:

```{r}
typeof(thing[[1]])
typeof(thing[[2]])
typeof(thing[[3]])
```

Good: they are vectors.
What do we get if we use single square brackets `[`?

```{r}
typeof(thing[1])
```

Sure enough, the value itself is a list:

```{r}
thing[1]
```

This shows the difference between `[[` and `[`:
the former peels away a layer of data structure, returning only the sub-structure,
while the latter gives us back a structure of the same type as the thing being indexed.
Since a "scalar" is just a vector of length 1,
there is no difference between the two when they are applied to vectors:

```{r}
v <- c("first", "second", "third")
v[2]
typeof(v[2])
v[[2]]
typeof(v[[2]])
```

> The answer is that R flattens the arguments to `c`,

> It also does automatic type conversion:
> `c("first", c(2, 20, 200), 30)` produces a vector of character strings
> `c("first", "2", "20", "200", "30")`.

> **Recursive Indexing**
>
> Using `[[` with a list subsets recursively:
> if `thing <- list(a = list(b = list(c = list(d = 1))))`,
> then `thing[[c("a", "b", "c", "d")]]` selects the 1.

## How can I access elements by name?

R allows us to name the elements in vectors:
if we assign `c(one = 1, two = 2, three = 3)` to `names`,
then `names["two"]` is 2.
We can use this to create a lookup table:

```{r}
values <- c("m", "f", "u", "f", "f", "m", "m")
lookup <- c(m = "Male", f = "Female", u = "Unstated")
lookup[values]
```

If the structure in question is a list rather than an atomic vector of numbers, characters, or logicals,
we can use the syntax `lookup$m` instead of `lookup["m"]`:

```{r}
lookup_list <- list(m = "Male", f = "Female", u = "Unstated")
lookup_list$m
```

We will explore this in more detail when we look at [the tidyverse](../tidyverse/),
since that is where access-by-name is used most often.
For now,
simply note that if the name of an element isn't a legal variable name,
we have to put it in backward quotes to use it as an accessor:

```{r}
another_list <- list("first field" = "F", "second field" = "S")
another_list$`first field`
```

Wherever possible, it's better to choose names that don't require back-quoting,
such as `first_first`.

## How can I create and index a matrix?

Matrices are frequently used in statistics, so R provides built-in support for them.
After `a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)`,
`a` is a 3x3 matrix containing the values 1 through 9.
What may surprise you is the order in which the values generated by the expression `1:9` are laid out:

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
a
```

Under the hood,
a matrix is a vector with an [attribute](../glossary/#attribute) called `dim` that stores its dimensions:

```{r}
dim(a)
```

`a[3, 3]` is a vector of length 1 containing the value 9 (because scalars in R are actually vectors),
while `a[1,]` is the vector `c(1, 4, 7)` (because we are selecting the first row of the matrix)
and `a[,1]` is the vector `c(1, 2, 3)` (because we are selecting the first column of the matrix).
Elements can still be accessed using a single index,
which returns the value from that location in the underlying vector:

```{r}
a[8]
```
