- Operations signal conditions in R when errors occur.
- The three built-in levels of conditions are messages, warnings, and errors.
- Programs can signal these themselves using the functions `message`, `warning`, and `stop`.
- Operations can be placed in a call to the function `try` to suppress errors, but this is a bad idea.
- Operations can be placed in a call to the function `tryCatch` to handle errors.
