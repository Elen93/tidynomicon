- Operations signal conditions in R when errors occur.
- The three built-in levels of conditions are messages, warnings, and errors.
- Programs can signal these themselves using the functions `message`, `warning`, and `stop`.
- Operations can be placed in a call to the function `try` to suppress errors, but this is a bad idea.
- Operations can be placed in a call to the function `tryCatch` to handle errors.
- Use testthat to write unit tests for R.
- Put unit tests for an R package in the `tests/testthat` directory.
- Put tests in files called <code>test_<em>group</em>.R</code> and call them <code>test_<em>something</em></code>.
- Use `test_dir` to run tests from a particular that match a pattern.
- Write tests for data transformation steps as well as library functions.
