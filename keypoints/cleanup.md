- Develop data-cleaning scripts one step at a time, checking intermediate results carefully.
- Use `read_csv` to read CSV-formatted tabular data into a tibble.
- Use the `skip` and `na` parameters of `read_csv` to skip rows and interpret certain values as `NA`.
- Use `str_replace` to replace portions of strings that match patterns with new strings.
- Use `is.numeric` to test if a value is a number and `as.numeric` to convert it to a number.
- Use `map` to apply a function to every element of a vector in turn.
- Use `map_dfc` and `map_dfr` to map functions across the columns and rows of a tibble.
- Pre-allocate storage in a list for each result from a loop and fill it in rather than repeatedly extending the list.
