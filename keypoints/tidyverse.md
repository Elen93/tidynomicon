- `install.packages('name')` installs packages.
- `library(name)` (without quoting the name) loads a package.
- `library(tidyverse)` loads the entire collection of tidyverse libraries at once.
- `read_csv(filename)` reads CSV files that use the string 'NA' to represent missing values.
- `read_csv` infers each column's data types based on the first thousand values it reads.
- A tibble is the tidyverse's version of a data frame, which represents tabular data.
- `head(tibble)` and `tail(tibble)` inspect the first and last few rows of a tibble.
- `summary(tibble)` displays a summary of a tibble's structure and values.
- `tibble$column` selects a column from a tibble, returning a vector as a result.
- `tibble['column']` selects a column from a tibble, returning a tibble as a result.
- `tibble[,c]` selects column `c` from a tibble, returning a tibble as a result.
- `tibble[r,]` selects row `r` from a tibble, returning a tibble as a result.
- Use ranges and logical vectors as indices to select multiple rows/columns or specific rows/columns from a tibble.
- `tibble[[c]]` selects column `c` from a tibble, returning a vector as a result.
- `min(...)`, `mean(...)`, `max(...)`, and `std(...)` calculates the minimum, mean, maximum, and standard deviation of data.
- These aggregate functions include `NA`s in their calculations, and so will produce `NA` if the input data contains any.
- Use `func(data, na.rm = TRUE)` to remove `NA`s from data before calculations are done (but make sure this is statistically justified).
- `filter(tibble, condition)` selects rows from a tibble that pass a logical test on their values.
- `arrange(tibble, column)` or `arrange(desc(column))` arrange rows according to values in a column (the latter in descending order).
- `select(tibble, column, column, ...)` selects columns from a tibble.
- `select(tibble, -column)` selects *out* a column from a tibble.
- `mutate(tibble, name = expression, name = expression, ...)` adds new columns to a tibble using values from existing columns.
- `group_by(tibble, column, column, ...)` groups rows that have the same values in the specified columns.
- `summarize(tibble, name = expression, name = expression)` aggregates tibble values (by groups if the rows have been grouped).
- `tibble %>% function(arguments)` performs the same operation as `function(tibble, arguments)`.
- Use `%>%` to create pipelines in which the left side of each `%>%` becomes the first argument of the next stage.
