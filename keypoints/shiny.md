- Every Shiny application has a user interface, a server, and a call to `shinyApp` that connects them.
- Every Shiny application must be in its own directory.
- Images and other static assets must be in that directory's `www` sub-directory.
- The `inputId` and `outputId` attributes of UI elements are used to refer to them from the server.
- Use `input$name` and `output$name` in the server to refer to UI elements.
- Code placed at the top of the script outside functions is run once when the app launches.
- Code placed inside `server` is run once for each user.
- Code placed inside a handler is run once on each change.
- A reactive variable is a function whose value changes automatically whenever anything it depends on changes.
- Use `reactive({...})` to create a reactive variable explicitly.
- The server can change UI elements via the `session` variable.
- Use `uiOutput` and `renderUI` to (re-)create UI elements as needed in order to break circular dependencies.
